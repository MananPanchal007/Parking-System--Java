This Parking Lot Management Application allows users to park and remove cars while managing available spots efficiently. It features a simple, interactive user interface and integrates with a MySQL database using JDBC and prepared statements. The app checks for available parking spots, parks cars, removes them when necessary, and displays the current status of the parking lot. It's a practical solution for managing small to medium-sized parking areas.
